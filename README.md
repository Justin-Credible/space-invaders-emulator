  - [X] Opcodes
  - [X] Interrupts
  - [X] I/O
  - [X] Unit Tests (600+!)
  - [X] Integration Test (cpudiag.bin) ðŸŽ‰
- [X] Space Invaders specific hardware
  - [X] CPU loop
  - [X] Interrupt generator
  - [X] I/O ports
  - [X] Shift register port
  - [X] Audio
  - [X] Framebuffer
- [ ] GUI / "Glue" Program
  - [X] CLI arguments parser
  - [X] Read ROM files
  - [X] SDL loop
  - [X] Read input keys
  - [ ] Play audio
  - [X] Render framebuffer
- [X] Debugging Tools
